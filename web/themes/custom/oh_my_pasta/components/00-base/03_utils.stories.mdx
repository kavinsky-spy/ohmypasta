# Utils

## Example component
Under `/02-molecules`, we have included an `example` molecule that can serve as a barebones reference component
that I can copy as a starting point when I create a new component.


## Container
By default, components will extend to the width of the screen (or the parent's width).
However, if you want any of your components to be wrapped in a `.container`,
there is a variable that you can set to true and it will add an extra class to your component's main wrapper.
This has been added to several relevant molecules and organisms.

However, if the component you need doesn't have this option, you can add it following the same structure, e.g.:
```
{% set example_contained = example_contained|default(false) %}
{% if example_contained %}
  {% set example_extra_classes = example_extra_classes|default([])|merge(['container']) %}
{% endif %}
```

So it will be added like this:
```
<div class"example container">
  ...
</div>
```

And don't forget to add it to Controls in your stories.js file!
