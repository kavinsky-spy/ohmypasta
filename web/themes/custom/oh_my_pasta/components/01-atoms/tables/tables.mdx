# Tables
The tables atom has a JS to make the table have a proper mobile design.
This mobile design repeats the header of the table to each row, making the table to be thinner.
When the header of the table is the first row, this mobile design works very well.
But it does not work well if the header is a column or multiple rows or columns.
In these cases, you have two additional configurations you can use that will be explained below.

## Table non-responsive
`table_non_responsive: true`
If this variable is true, it adds the class `table--non-responsive` to the table tag,
making the mobile design not be added to the table.
So the table keeps the same design on desktop and mobile.

## Table scrollable
`table_scrollable: true`
If this variable is true, it adds the class `table--scroll` to the table.
That adds a `div` tag wrapping the table with style to make the table scrollable.
It only works if table_non_responsive is true as well, as it won't be necessary when it has the proper mobile design.

## Additional Notes
If the table is added via Wysiwyg, the option to add these two variables should be added to Wysiwyg,
to be available to the content editor.

On the twig file, there are different kinds of tables to show the variations.
